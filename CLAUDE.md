This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CellCount is an AI-assisted web application for counting red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs) in blood smear images. The application will use machine learning for automatic cell detection with the ability to fine-tune models using custom image data.

## Agent Workflow

This project uses a multi-agent workflow defined in `AGENTS.md`. When working on this project, assume one of these roles as appropriate:

- **Team Leader** - Coordinates work, makes decisions, escalates to user when needed
- **Researcher** - Literature review, finds open-source solutions, evaluates ML models
- **Full Stack Developer** - Implements web app, integrates ML models
- **UX Designer** - Ensures design harmony, typography hierarchy, accessibility
- **DevOps** - Hosting, CI/CD, infrastructure as code
- **QE** - Test strategy and automation

See `AGENTS.md` for detailed responsibilities and workflow phases.

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Research - Finding open-source solutions for blood cell counting
